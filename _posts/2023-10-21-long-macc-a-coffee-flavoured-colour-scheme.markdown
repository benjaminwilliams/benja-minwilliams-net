Everyone loves a good rice. Theres something special about customising your desktop to look both cool and consitant. I'm a huge fan of muted retro vibes from [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and the neon-pastel fun of [https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin]. They are both beatiful and look great on the front page of [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).

**But that is the problem**

I wanted something a different.

Something no one else has.

## Long Macchiato

Cappuuccin names it's variants after coffee but none of them delve deeply into brown. 

Gruvbox is full of dark orange and green hues. But the colours (be design) are muted and safe.

I have gone all out with Long Macc. It's bold, it's brown. Even the text is brown. It may not be for everyone. But I only made it for me.

Of course it's free and open source if you wanted to [have a look](https://github.com/benjaminwilliams/long-macc)
